# 🔄 NFA to DFA Converter

## 📘 Overview

This Java application converts a **Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA)** into a **Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)**. It then checks if a given string is accepted by the DFA and prints the path it takes during traversal.

This project was written in the **Spring of 2022** as part of a **Languages and Automata course** 📚, focusing on formal language theory and automata design.

## ✨ Features
- Converts NFA to DFA 🛠️.
- Accepts strings and determines if they belong to the DFA ✅.
- Prints the traversing path through the DFA for each string 🛤️.
